# High-Speed-Pipelined-Multiplier-using-Carry-Save-Adder
High-Speed Pipelined Multiplier using Carry Save Adder (CSA) implemented in Verilog HDL. The project improves multiplication speed by reducing carry propagation delay through CSA-based reduction and pipelining. Developed as a B.Tech major project and verified using Xilinx Vivado.


# High Speed Pipelined Multiplier Using Carry Save Adder

## Overview

This project presents the design and implementation of a High-Speed Pipelined Multiplier using Carry Save Adders (CSA). The multiplier is designed to reduce propagation delay and improve throughput by combining Carry Save Addition with pipelining techniques.

The project was developed as my B.Tech Major Project using Verilog HDL and simulated using Xilinx Vivado.
